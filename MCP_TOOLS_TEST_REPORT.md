ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS: MCP server is properly exposing 8 tools
```

### SDK Compliance Verification

The server implementation has been updated to strictly follow the official Python SDK patterns:

#### Before (Non-compliant)
```python
# Old pattern - caused tool exposure issues
async def call_tool(name: str, arguments: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[types.TextContent]:
    handlers = {
        "analyze_codebase": handle_analyze_codebase,
        # ... complex dispatch
    }
    handler = handlers.get(name)
    return await handler(engine, arguments)
```

#### After (SDK-compliant)
```python
# New pattern - matches official SDK examples
async def call_tool(name: str, arguments: dict) -> list[types.TextContent]:
    if name == "analyze_codebase":
        return await handle_analyze_codebase(engine, arguments)
    elif name == "find_definition":
        return await handle_find_definition(engine, arguments)
    # ... direct if/elif dispatch like SDK examples
```

### Configuration Status

#### MCP Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "code-graph-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "code-graph-mcp",
      "args": ["--project-root", "."],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Code Integration
```bash
$ claude mcp list
Checking MCP server health...

code-graph-mcp: code-graph-mcp  - âœ“ Connected
```

## Multi-Language Support

## Installation and Usage

### PyPI Installation
```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install code-graph-mcp

# Add to Claude Code (project-scoped)
claude mcp add --scope project code-graph-mcp code-graph-mcp --project-root .

# Verify installation
claude mcp list
```

### Development Installation
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/entrepeneur4lyf/code-graph-mcp
cd code-graph-mcp
uv sync --dev

# Test locally
uv run code-graph-mcp --project-root . --verbose
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Tools Not Exposed
**Problem**: `claude mcp list` shows server connected but tools not accessible  
**Solution**: Ensure server follows SDK patterns (this issue has been resolved in v1.0.4)

#### 2. Analysis Hangs
**Problem**: Server times out during project analysis  
**Solution**: Use `--verbose` flag to identify problematic files, add to `.gitignore`

#### 3. Language Not Supported
**Problem**: `LanguageNotSupported` error for specific file types  
**Solution**: File type not supported by ast-grep backend, will be skipped automatically

## Conclusion

The Code Graph MCP Server is fully functional and ready for production use. All 8 tools are properly exposed and accessible through Claude Code's MCP interface. The server provides comprehensive multi-language code analysis capabilities with enterprise-grade performance and reliability.
