# Documentation

This folder contains the in-repo documentation for the CodeNavigator (codenav) project.

Canonical location for docs is recorded in docs/LOCATION.md. Use this README to find key doc locations:

- docs/LOCATION.md - explains canonical docs location and detection rules
- docs/ADR_TEMPLATE.md - template for Architectural Decision Records
- docs/sessions/ - session logs and notebooks related to documentation changes

Contributing:
- Add ADRs to docs/adr/ and reference them in PR descriptions when relevant.
- Keep docs small and version-controlled. Prefer documentation in Markdown.
