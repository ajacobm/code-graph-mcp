# MCP Tools Test Results Report

**Date:** July 25, 2025  
**Version:** code-graph-mcp v1.0.5  
**Test Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL SUCCESS  

## Executive Summary

The MCP server successfully exposes all 8 tools and establishes proper connectivity. However, there is a critical runtime issue with clojure file processing that prevents full tool functionality testing.

## Connectivity Test Results

### ‚úÖ Server Connection Test
```
üîó Testing MCP Server Connectivity
========================================
‚úÖ Server connection established

üìã Listing Tools...
‚úÖ Found 8 tools:
  ‚Ä¢ analyze_codebase: Perform comprehensive codebase analysis with metrics and structure overview
  ‚Ä¢ find_definition: Find the definition of a symbol (function, class, variable)
  ‚Ä¢ find_references: Find all references to a symbol throughout the codebase
  ‚Ä¢ find_callers: Find all functions that call the specified function
  ‚Ä¢ find_callees: Find all functions called by the specified function
  ‚Ä¢ complexity_analysis: Analyze code complexity and refactoring opportunities
  ‚Ä¢ dependency_analysis: Analyze module dependencies and import relationships
  ‚Ä¢ project_statistics: Get comprehensive project statistics and health metrics

üéØ SUCCESS: MCP server is properly exposing 8 tools
```

### ‚úÖ Tool Exposure Verification
- **Total Tools Exposed**: 8/8 ‚úÖ
- **MCP Protocol Compliance**: ‚úÖ 
- **Claude Code Integration**: ‚úÖ (`claude mcp list` shows "Connected")
- **Server Initialization**: ‚úÖ

## Individual Tool Test Results

| Tool | Status | Issue |
|------|--------|-------|
| `analyze_codebase` | ‚ùå CRASH | Clojure file processing error |
| `find_definition` | ‚ùå CRASH | Requires project analysis first |
| `find_references` | ‚ùå CRASH | Requires project analysis first |
| `find_callers` | ‚ùå CRASH | Requires project analysis first |
| `find_callees` | ‚ùå CRASH | Requires project analysis first |
| `complexity_analysis` | ‚ùå CRASH | Requires project analysis first |
| `dependency_analysis` | ‚ùå CRASH | Requires project analysis first |
| `project_statistics` | ‚ùå CRASH | Clojure file processing error |

## Critical Issue Identified

### üö® Clojure File Processing Crash
```
thread '<unnamed>' panicked at crates/pyo3/src/lib.rs:44:37:
called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: LanguageNotSupported("clojure")
```

**Root Cause**: The ast-grep backend encounters clojure files during project analysis and crashes instead of gracefully skipping unsupported languages.

**Impact**: All tools that require project analysis fail immediately, preventing any functional testing.

**Location**: Error occurs in `universal_parser.py:409` during `SgRoot(content, language_config.ast_grep_id)` call.

## Technical Analysis

### Working Components ‚úÖ
1. **MCP Server Startup**: Server initializes correctly
2. **Tool Registration**: All 8 tools properly registered and exposed
3. **Protocol Communication**: MCP protocol communication working
4. **SDK Compliance**: Follows official Python SDK patterns exactly

### Failing Components ‚ùå
1. **Project Analysis**: Crashes on clojure file processing
2. **Error Handling**: No graceful fallback for unsupported languages
3. **Tool Execution**: Cannot complete due to analysis failure

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Required
1. **Add Language Error Handling**: Wrap `SgRoot` calls in try/catch to skip unsupported files
2. **Improve File Filtering**: Better detection and exclusion of unsupported file types
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Allow tools to work with partial analysis when some files fail

### Code Fix Example
```python
# In universal_parser.py around line 409
try:
    sg_root = SgRoot(content, language_config.ast_grep_id)
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Skipping unsupported file {file_path}: {e}")
    return False  # Skip this file and continue
```

## Production Readiness Assessment

### Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS FIXES
- **Connectivity**: ‚úÖ Production Ready
- **Tool Exposure**: ‚úÖ Production Ready  
- **Error Handling**: ‚ùå Critical Issue
- **Functionality**: ‚ùå Blocked by Crash

### Next Steps
1. Fix clojure file processing crash
2. Add comprehensive error handling for unsupported languages
3. Re-test all 8 tools with fix applied
4. Publish v1.0.6 with crash fix

## Conclusion

The MCP server architecture and tool exposure are working correctly. The SDK compliance fixes in v1.0.5 successfully resolved the tool accessibility issues. However, a critical runtime crash prevents actual tool functionality testing and would block production use.

**Priority**: HIGH - Fix language processing crash to enable full tool functionality.
