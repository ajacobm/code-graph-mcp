# Crush Session Memory

## Bash Session Init
Always initialize sessions with: `source ~/.bashrc`

## Docker Commands
- View logs: `docker logs code-graph-mcp-code-graph-codegraphmcp-sse-1`
- List running containers: `docker ps -a | grep code-graph`
- Restart stack: `docker-compose -f docker-compose-multi.yml down && docker-compose -f docker-compose-multi.yml up -d`

## Development Commands
- Run tests: `pytest tests/`
- Type check: `mypy src/`
- Lint: `ruff check src/`
- Build Docker: `docker build -t ajacobm/code-graph-mcp:sse -f Dockerfile .`

## Workspace Setup
The `/app/workspace` volume in Docker is mounted from `repo-mount` volume (empty by default).
To analyze code:
1. Mount a real repo to the volume in docker-compose-multi.yml, or
2. Clone a repo into the volume from container startup

## Key Architecture Notes
- `UniversalAnalysisEngine` has `analyzer` (UniversalASTAnalyzer) which holds the `cache_manager`
- Property added to `UniversalAnalysisEngine.cache_manager` for safe access
- SSE server uses `StreamableHTTPSessionManager` from official MCP SDK
- Health check endpoint at `/health` safely checks Redis connectivity
- File watcher: `get_supported_extensions()` is async, must be awaited in `start_file_watcher()`
- MCP handlers: Added `list_prompts()` and `list_resources()` handlers to prevent "Method not found" errors

## Recent Fixes (2025-10-25)
1. Fixed `cache_manager` AttributeError in health checks - added property delegation
2. Fixed file watcher coroutine not awaited - now properly awaits `get_supported_extensions()`
3. Added missing MCP protocol handlers for prompts and resources
4. All tools (get_usage_guide, analyze_codebase) now execute without errors
