# docker-compose.override.yml
# Local development overrides for bind mounts
# Copy to docker-compose.override.yml and adjust paths as needed
# Docker Compose automatically loads this file if it exists

# This example shows how to override volumes for local development
# on a Windows/Mac machine with persistent storage paths

version: "3.9"

services:
  redis:
    # Uncomment and adjust path for local persistent Redis data
    # volumes:
    #   - /mnt/c/Users/ADAM/.redis-docker/codegraphmcp:/data

  code-graph-sse:
    # Uncomment and adjust paths for local development
    # volumes:
    #   - /mnt/c/Users/ADAM/GitHub/code-graph-mcp:/app
    #   - /mnt/c/Users/ADAM/GitHub/code-graph-mcp:/app/workspace

  memgraph:
    # Uncomment and adjust path for local persistent Memgraph data
    # volumes:
    #   - /mnt/c/Users/ADAM/.memgraph-docker/codegraphmcp:/var/lib/memgraph

# Note: Docker Compose loads docker-compose.override.yml automatically
# if it exists in the same directory as docker-compose.yml.
# This allows you to override settings without modifying the base file.
# 
# Examples for different environments:
# 
# Codespaces (default - no overrides needed):
# - Uses Docker volumes (redis-data, memgraph-data, repo-mount)
# - No bind mounts required
# - Just run: make test-up
#
# Local Linux/Mac:
# - Uncomment the volume overrides below
# - Adjust paths to your local directories
# - Run: make test-up
#
# Local Windows (WSL2):
# - Use /mnt/c/Users/... paths for Windows directories
# - Or better: place code in WSL filesystem at ~/code/code-graph-mcp
# - Run: make test-up
