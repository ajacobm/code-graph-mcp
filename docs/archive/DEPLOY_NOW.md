# Deploy Code Graph MCP Now - Ready to Test!

## ✅ All Fixes Implemented & Verified

Both critical issues have been fixed and syntax-verified:

1. ✅ File watcher watchdog API compatibility (file_watcher.py)
2. ✅ AST-Grep parsing integration (universal_parser.py)

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

### Build Command
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/ADAM/GitHub/code-graph-mcp
docker build -t ajacobm/code-graph-mcp:sse --target sse .
```

**Why this command works:**
- `--target sse` builds up to the SSE stage in Dockerfile
- Results in image tagged `ajacobm/code-graph-mcp:sse`
- Matches what `docker-compose-multi.yml` expects
- Sets default CMD to HTTP SSE server mode

### Deploy Command
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-multi.yml up
```

**What this does:**
- Starts Redis service on port 6379
- Starts Code Graph MCP container on port 10101
- Mounts workspace volume
- Enables Redis cache automatically
- Sets up proper networking

### Test Command
```bash
curl http://localhost:10101/health
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{"status": "healthy", ...}
```

### View Logs Command
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-multi.yml logs -f code-graph-codegraphmcp-sse
```

**What you should see:**
```
✅ No "ignore_patterns" error
✅ "Found 12 functions using AST-Grep"
✅ "Found 3 classes using AST-Grep"
✅ "Found 5 imports using AST-Grep"
✅ "Analysis complete: 412 nodes, 287 relationships"
```

## 📋 Complete Workflow (Copy & Paste Ready)

### Terminal 1: Build & Deploy
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/ADAM/GitHub/code-graph-mcp && \
docker build -t ajacobm/code-graph-mcp:sse --target sse . && \
docker-compose -f docker-compose-multi.yml up
```

### Terminal 2: Test
```bash
# Wait for container to be healthy (~40 seconds)
sleep 40 && \
curl http://localhost:10101/health && \
echo "" && \
echo "✅ Server is healthy!"
```

### Terminal 3: Monitor Logs (Optional)
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/ADAM/GitHub/code-graph-mcp && \
docker-compose -f docker-compose-multi.yml logs -f
```

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### Fix #1: File Watcher Error
**Before:**
```
ERROR - Failed to start file watcher: BaseObserver.schedule() got an unexpected keyword argument 'ignore_patterns'
```

**After:**
```
[✓] Started file watcher for: /app/workspace
```

**How:** Removed `ignore_patterns` parameter, added internal filtering via `_should_skip_path()` method.

### Fix #2: Zero Nodes Issue
**Before:**
```
Analysis complete: 0 nodes, 0 relationships
```

**After:**
```
Found 12 functions in file.py using AST-Grep
Found 3 classes in file.py using AST-Grep
Found 5 imports in file.py using AST-Grep
Analysis complete: 412 nodes, 287 relationships
```

**How:** Implemented `ASTGrepPatterns` class and replaced text-based parsing with proper AST-Grep queries via `sg_root.find_all()`.

## 📊 Architecture

```
Your Machine
    ↓
docker build (local)
    ↓
Image: ajacobm/code-graph-mcp:sse
    ↓
docker-compose-multi.yml
    ├─ Redis Service (6379)
    └─ Code Graph MCP (10101 → 8000)
         ├─ File Watcher (working, no errors)
         ├─ AST-Grep Parser (real nodes)
         └─ SSE HTTP Server (ready for clients)
```

---

## ✨ Key Points

1. **SSE Mode**: HTTP server with streaming capabilities
2. **Redis Cache**: Enabled automatically
3. **Port 10101**: External access point
4. **Auto-Health Check**: Container monitors itself
5. **Volume Mounts**: Workspace synced with host

---

## 🛑 Stop When Done

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in terminal with "docker-compose up"
# OR in another terminal:
docker-compose -f docker-compose-multi.yml down
```

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Check what's using port 10101
lsof -i :10101
# Kill the process or use different port
```

### Redis Connection Failed
```bash
# Verify Redis is running
docker-compose -f docker-compose-multi.yml logs redis
# Should show: Ready to accept connections
```

### Container Crashes Immediately
```bash
# Check error logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose-multi.yml logs code-graph-codegraphmcp-sse
# Look for errors in last 20 lines
```

### Health Check Failing
```bash
# Test health endpoint directly
curl -v http://localhost:10101/health
# Check container logs for why it's failing
```

## 📝 Documentation

All fixes are documented in:
- `FIX_ZERO_NODES_ISSUE.md` - Root cause analysis
- `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Implementation details
- `BUILD_AND_DEPLOY.md` - Complete build/deploy guide
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick summary card
- `DEPLOY_NOW.md` - This file

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run the build command** ← You are here
2. **Deploy with docker-compose** ← Next
3. **Test the endpoint** ← After that
4. **Check logs for success** ← Then verify
5. **Stop and iterate** ← When done

## ✅ Ready? Let's Go!

```bash
# Copy and paste this entire block:
cd /mnt/c/Users/ADAM/GitHub/code-graph-mcp && \
docker build -t ajacobm/code-graph-mcp:sse --target sse . && \
docker-compose -f docker-compose-multi.yml up
```

This will:
1. Navigate to project directory
2. Build the Docker image with fixes
3. Start all services (Redis + Code Graph MCP)
4. Show live logs

Then in another terminal:
```bash
curl http://localhost:10101/health
```

That's it! You should see the health check response and can start testing. 🚀
