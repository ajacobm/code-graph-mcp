### File Watcher (v1.1.0+)

The server includes an intelligent file watcher that automatically updates the code graph when files change:

- **Automatic Detection**: Monitors all supported file types in your project
- **Smart Debouncing**: 2-second delay prevents excessive re-analysis during rapid changes
- **Efficient Filtering**: Respects `.gitignore` patterns and only watches relevant files
- **Thread-Safe**: Runs in background without blocking analysis operations
- **Zero Configuration**: Starts automatically after first analysis

**File Watcher Features:**
- Real-time graph updates during development
- Batch processing of multiple rapid changes
- Duplicate change prevention
- Graceful error recovery
- Resource cleanup on shutdown

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **"Command not found"**: Ensure `code-graph-mcp` is in your PATH
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade code-graph-mcp
   which code-graph-mcp
   ```

2. **"ast-grep not found"**: Install the required dependency
   ```bash
   pip install ast-grep-py
   ```

3. **Permission errors**: Use virtual environment
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   # or
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   pip install code-graph-mcp ast-grep-py rustworkx
   ```

4. **Large project performance**: Use verbose mode for debugging
   ```bash
   code-graph-mcp --verbose
   ```

#### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
code-graph-mcp --verbose
```
