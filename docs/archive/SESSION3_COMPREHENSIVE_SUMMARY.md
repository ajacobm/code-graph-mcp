# Code Graph MCP - Comprehensive Investigation Summary
## Sessions 1-3 (Oct 25-26, 2025)

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

The Code Graph MCP project has been thoroughly investigated across three sessions to resolve the "0 nodes" graph population issue. While multiple fixes have been applied and verified in isolation, the core graph population layer still requires focused debugging to complete the implementation.

**Current Status**: 
- ‚úÖ All library APIs verified and working correctly
- ‚úÖ AST-Grep integration implemented and tested
- ‚úÖ 25+ language patterns defined and complete
- ‚ùå Graph nodes still not being populated in production container
- üîç Root cause: debugging output being suppressed or exception handling

---

## üìã Investigation Timeline

### Session 1 (Oct 25, 2025)
**Focus**: Initial diagnosis of watchdog and AST parsing issues

**Discoveries**:
1. **File Watcher Watchdog Incompatibility** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Problem: `ignore_patterns` parameter removed in watchdog 6.0.0+
   - Solution: Removed parameter, moved filtering to event handler
   - File: `src/code_graph_mcp/file_watcher.py`
   - Status: Implementation complete and verified

2. **AST-Grep Pattern Mismatch** ‚úÖ FIXED  
   - Problem: Patterns like `function_def` didn't match actual AST node types
   - Solution: Corrected to `function_definition` for Python and all 25 languages
   - File: `src/code_graph_mcp/universal_parser.py`
   - Pattern coverage: All 25 languages now have complete function/class/import/variable patterns

3. **Iterator Consumption Bug** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Problem: `find_all()` returns iterator that was never converted to list
   - Solution: Added `list()` conversion at 3 locations in parsing methods
   - Lines: 662-665, 722-729, 786-793 in `universal_parser.py`

**Outcome**: Both watchdog API compatibility and AST-Grep integration believed fixed

---

### Session 2 (Oct 26, 2025) - Deep Dive Investigation
**Focus**: Verified the fixes work but identified remaining graph population issue

**Critical Discovery**: 
- ‚úÖ Local Python tests confirm ast-grep-py works perfectly
- ‚úÖ All 7 test language patterns parse correctly
- ‚úÖ Test file (universal_parser.py) correctly found:
  - 32 functions
  - 4 classes
  - 6 imports
- ‚úÖ Both sync and async contexts work fine
- ‚ùå BUT: Container deployment still produces 0 nodes

**Why This Matters**:
The problem is NOT with the AST-Grep library or the API usage. The library works perfectly in local testing. The issue must be in the integration layer - either:
1. Parsing methods not being called
2. DEBUG logs being suppressed (so we can't see what's happening)
3. Exceptions being silently caught
4. Graph node creation failing

**Testing Evidence**:
```python
# Local test - WORKS PERFECTLY
from ast_grep_py import SgRoot
code = "def hello(): pass\nclass Foo: pass"
sg = SgRoot(code, 'python')
root = sg.root()  # ‚úÖ Works instantly
functions = list(root.find_all({"rule": {"kind": "function_definition"}}))
# Returns: [SgNode object] with correct function
```

---

### Session 3 (Current) - Code Review & Final Analysis
**Focus**: Review all changes and prepare next steps for debugging

**Findings**:
1. All fixes have been correctly implemented in `universal_parser.py`
2. AST-Grep pattern definitions are complete for all 25 languages
3. Iterator conversion (list()) is in place at all 3 parsing method locations
4. File watcher API is compatible with watchdog 6.0.0+
5. Container build is ready with all fixes

**Key Implementation Details** (verified in code):

Lines 607-619: ASTGrepPatterns class with all 25 languages
```python
PATTERNS = {
    "python": {
        "function": "function_definition",    # ‚úÖ Corrected pattern
        "class": "class_definition",
        "import": "import_statement",
        "variable": "assignment",
    },
    # ... 24 more languages ...
}
```

Lines 662-680: _parse_functions_ast with proper AST API
```python
root_node = sg_root.root()  # ‚úÖ Correct API call
functions = list(root_node.find_all({"rule": {"kind": pattern}}))  # ‚úÖ Convert to list
for func_node in functions:  # ‚úÖ Now properly iterates
```

Lines 728-746: Similar implementation for _parse_classes_ast
Lines 794-812: Similar implementation for _parse_imports_ast

---

## üîß What Has Been Fixed

### 1. File Watcher API Compatibility ‚úÖ
**Issue**: watchdog 6.0.0+ removed `ignore_patterns` parameter
**Solution**: 
- Removed `ignore_patterns` from `observer.schedule()` call
- Moved filtering to event handler methods (`_should_skip_path()`)
- Added ignore logic to all event handlers (on_modified, on_created, on_deleted, on_moved)

**File**: `src/code_graph_mcp/file_watcher.py`

**Status**: COMPLETE - Ready for production

---

### 2. AST-Grep Integration ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Parsing methods used text-based fallback instead of actual AST queries
**Solution**:
- Created ASTGrepPatterns class with language-specific patterns
- Implemented _parse_functions_ast() with proper AST-Grep queries
- Implemented _parse_classes_ast() with proper AST-Grep queries
- Implemented _parse_imports_ast() with proper AST-Grep queries
- Added AST node extraction helpers (_extract_name_from_ast, _extract_import_target_from_ast)

**File**: `src/code_graph_mcp/universal_parser.py`

**Status**: COMPLETE - API calls verified working

---

### 3. Iterator Consumption Bug ‚úÖ
**Issue**: `find_all()` returns iterator that was never materialized
**Solution**: Added `list()` conversion to force iterator evaluation

**Locations**:
- Line 664: `functions = list(root_node.find_all({...}))`
- Line 728: `classes = list(root_node.find_all({...}))`
- Line 798: `imports = list(root_node.find_all({...}))`

**Status**: COMPLETE - Verified in local tests

---

### 4. Pattern Dictionary Coverage ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Only 6 of 25 languages had AST patterns defined
**Solution**: Added patterns for all 25 languages

**Languages Added**:
- cpp, c, csharp, php, ruby, swift, kotlin, scala, dart, lua
- haskell, elixir, erlang, r, matlab, perl, sql, html, css

**Status**: COMPLETE - All patterns verified non-empty and valid

---

## ‚ùå Outstanding Issue: Graph Population

**Problem**: 
- parse_file() returns True (parsing succeeds)
- File node is created ‚úì
- But no function/class/import nodes appear in graph

**Hypothesis**:
The parsing methods (_parse_functions_ast, etc.) are:
1. Being called ‚úì (parse_file returns True)
2. Executing without exceptions
3. But NOT creating nodes in self.graph

**Possible Root Causes**:
1. **DEBUG logging suppressed**: We can't see debug output to trace execution
2. **Silent exception handling**: try/except blocks catching and hiding errors
3. **Graph node creation failing**: self.graph.add_node() throwing exception
4. **Async/await issue**: Maybe parsing methods not properly awaited (though tests show async works)
5. **Timing issue**: Graph methods called but not persisting

**Evidence for Debugging Logs Being Suppressed**:
- Lines 1011-1085 in _parse_file_content have 10+ debug log statements
- Lines 654+ in _parse_functions_ast have debug logs
- Similar for _parse_classes_ast and _parse_imports_ast
- But these logs don't appear in container output
- This suggests logging config suppressing DEBUG level

---

## üîç Recommended Next Steps (For Session 4+)

### Immediate Priority: Add Visible Output to Trace Execution

Replace debug logging with print() statements to force output:

```python
def _parse_functions_ast(self, sg_root: Any, file_path: Path, language_config: LanguageConfig) -> int:
    """Parse functions using AST-Grep queries."""
    count = 0
    try:
        pattern = ASTGrepPatterns.get_pattern(language_config.ast_grep_id, "function")
        print(f"[TRACE] _parse_functions_ast: pattern='{pattern}'")  # ‚Üê Force output
        if pattern:
            try:
                root_node = sg_root.root()
                print(f"[TRACE] sg_root.root() succeeded")  # ‚Üê Force output
                functions = list(root_node.find_all({"rule": {"kind": pattern}}))
                print(f"[TRACE] Found {len(functions)} functions")  # ‚Üê Force output
                for func_node in functions:
                    try:
                        func_name = self._extract_name_from_ast(func_node, language_config)
                        print(f"[TRACE] Extracted function: {func_name}")  # ‚Üê Force output
                        # ... rest of node creation ...
                        print(f"[TRACE] Created node: {node.id}")  # ‚Üê Force output
                        self.graph.add_node(node)
                        print(f"[TRACE] Node added to graph")  # ‚Üê Force output
                        count += 1
                    except Exception as e:
                        print(f"[TRACE] Error in func_node processing: {e}")  # ‚Üê Show errors
                        import traceback
                        traceback.print_exc()  # ‚Üê Full traceback
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"[TRACE] Error querying functions: {e}")  # ‚Üê Show errors
                import traceback
                traceback.print_exc()
        print(f"[TRACE] _parse_functions_ast returning count={count}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[TRACE] Outer exception: {e}")
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc()
    
    return count
```

### Testing Workflow:

1. **Add print() tracing to all parsing methods**
   - Replace logger.debug() with print(f"[TRACE] ...")
   - Add try/except with full traceback printing

2. **Rebuild container with tracing enabled**
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/Users/ADAM/GitHub/code-graph-mcp
   docker build -t ajacobm/code-graph-mcp:sse --target sse .
   ```

3. **Run container and check output**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-multi.yml down
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-multi.yml up
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-multi.yml logs code-graph-codegraphmcp-sse
   ```

4. **Analyze output to find exact failure point**
   - If prints appear: execute path is correct, issue is in node creation or exception handling
   - If prints don't appear: parsing methods not being called or early exception
   - If exceptions shown: know exact error to fix

### Expected Outcomes After Adding Tracing:

**Scenario A**: Prints appear, functions found, but nodes not in graph
- Means: self.graph.add_node() might be failing silently
- Fix: Check graph.add_node() implementation for exceptions
- Or: Cache manager might be preventing persistence

**Scenario B**: Prints appear, functions found=0
- Means: AST-Grep queries returning empty
- Fix: Verify pattern names match actual language AST nodes
- Or: Check language_config.ast_grep_id is correct

**Scenario C**: Prints don't appear, method not called
- Means: _parse_functions_ast etc. not being invoked
- Fix: Check if exceptions in _parse_file_content before calling these methods
- Or: Language detection failing silently

**Scenario D**: Exception traceback shown
- Means: Know exact error to fix
- Fix: Will be clear from traceback
